	'bio': '<h3>Relationships</h3><p>In the past, Keanu has been linked to actresses Parker Posey, Lynn Collins, Jennifer Syme and China Chow (the daughter of restaurant owner Mr Chow). Keanu nearly became a father with girlfriend Jennifer Syme in 1999, but the baby was stillborn. He was faced with more tragedy when, just 16 months later, Jennifer was killed in a car accident.</p><h3>Before They Were Famous</h3><p>Keanu was born in Lebanon to dad Samuel Nowlin Reeves, who was a geologist, and mum Patricia Taylor, a costume designer who worked for rock stars including Alice Cooper. Keanu – whose name in Hawaiian means  cool breeze over the mountains’ – has one sister and two half-sisters. After his parents divorced, Keanu’s mum went on to marry a further three times.<br /><br />A young Keanu was not particularly interested in education (he attended four different high schools, including the Etobicoke School of the Arts, from which he was expelled) but showed a keen interest in and talent for ice hockey. He eventually lost all interest in school and dropped out at 17 to pursue his true passion – acting.<br /><br />After landing a couple of stage gigs and movies that were not particularly well received, he scored the role in hockey flick <em>Youngblood</em> (1986), filmed in Canada. Once filming wrapped up, he left and drove to Hollywood in his 1969 Volvo to pursue his budding career.<br /><br />Keanu popped up in a few films like <em>River’s Edge</em> (1986) and <em>Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure</em> (1989), which garnered praise and commercial success. The latter developed a huge following by audiences who were unable to differentiate between his on-screen character and off-screen persona. Unable to shake the character from <em>Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure</em>, Keanu moved on to more intellectual and challenging films, such as 1993’s Shakespeare adaptation of <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>. </p><h3>Career Highlights</h3><p>Keanu’s big break came in 1992 when he scored a role in <em>Point Break</em> alongside Patrick Swayze. He then went on to film 1994’s big-budget action film <em>Speed</em>, starring opposite Sandra Bullock. His next choices were eclectic, with a return to smaller indie films such as <em>Feeling Minnesota</em> (1996) and <em>The Last Time I Committed Suicide</em> (1997) and bigger – but critically panned – flicks including <em>Johnny Mnemonic </em>(1995) and <em>Chain Reaction</em> (1996).<br /><br />Hollywood was stunned when Keanu turned down the sequel to <em>Speed</em> to instead play the title role in a small theatre production of <em>Hamlet</em>. However, he struck gold a few years later when he accepted a role in <em>The Matrix</em> (1999), which went on to produce two further sequels and a string of positive reviews. In the past decade, Keanu has starred in a range of films including <em>The Gift</em> (2000), <em>Constantine</em> (2005), <em>Street Kings</em> (2008), <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> (2008) and most recently in 2009, <em>The Private Lives of Pippa Lee</em>, in which he starred alongside big names including Robin Wright Penn, Julianne Moore, Winona Ryder and Blake Lively.<br /><br />Upcoming projects include a film adaptation of the anime series <em>Cowboy Behop</em> and the samurai film <em>47 Ronin</em>. </p><h3>Famous Quotes</h3><p> It\'s always wonderful to get to know women, with the mystery and the joy and the depth. If you can make a woman laugh, you are seeing the most beautiful thing on God\'s Earth.’</p>'

	'bio': 'Born on August 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California, to Charles Robert Redford, an accountant for Standard Oil, and Martha Hart. His mother died in 1955, the year after he graduated from high school. Charles Robert Redford Jr. was a scrappy kid who stole hubcaps in high school and lost his college baseball scholarship at the University of Colorado because of drunkenness. After studying at the Pratt Institute of Art and living the painter\'s life in Europe, he studied acting in New York at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Lola Van Wagenen (consumer activist), born in 1940, dropped out of college to marry Redford on September 12, 1958. They divorced in 1985 after having four children, one of whom died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Daughter Shauna Redford, born November 15, 1960, is a painter who married Eric Schlosser on October 5, 1985, in Provo, UT. Her first child, born in January 1991, made Redford a grandfather. Son James Redford (aka Jamie Redford), a screenwriter, was born May 5, 1962. Daughter Amy Redford, an actress; was born October 22, 1970. Redford also has a brother named William.\n\nTelevision and stage experience coupled with all-American good looks led to movies and television roles. His breakthrough role was "The Sundance Kid" in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), when the actor was 32. The Way We Were (1973) and The Sting (1973), both in 1973, made Redford the number one box office star for the next three years. Redford used his clout to advance environmental causes and his riches to acquire Utah property, which he transformed into a ranch and the Sundance ski resort. In 1980, he established the Sundance Institute for aspiring filmmakers. Its annual film festival has become one of the world\'s most influential. Redford\'s directorial debut, Ordinary People (1980), won him the Academy Award as Best Director in 1981. He waited eight years before getting behind the camera again, this time for the screen version of John Nichols\' acclaimed novel of the Southwest, The Milagro Beanfield War (1988). He scored with critics and fans in 1992 with the Brad Pitt film A River Runs Through It (1992), and again, in 1994, with Quiz Show (1994), which earned him yet another Best Director nomination.'
